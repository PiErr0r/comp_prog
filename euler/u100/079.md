### Solution

Since I have no idea how to solve this by computer (I have some but lets not go there) I silved i tby hand.

The problema states that the numbers are always in order which means that the solution is pretty straight forward.

You go number by number (there is no 4 nor 5 in the list) and check which numbers are before/after (any approach is fine) other numbers and you get the solution which is: `73162890`
